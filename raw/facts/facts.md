* synchronous code wait for the execution of code  
* async code doesnt wait for in b/w code and execute that in other api and execute further work
* its a good practice to type async code and it is much faster
* as aasync code is always of some api so we have to handle it properly
* three ways to handle it is:
                    1 -> callback  
                    2 ->  promises (es6/es2015)
                    3 ->  async/await
* use json validators to validate json
